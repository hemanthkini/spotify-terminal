# Spotify-terminal

Control Spotify from your terminal. In active development.

## Installation

Prerequisites: python3, pip3, Spotify premium account

1. Set up the credentials file from the template.
2. Run 'make install' to install dependencies and copy the script to /usr/local/bin. I recommend setting up an alias, like 'sp'.
